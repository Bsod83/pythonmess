the mess of python code i have done
lightsmotors.py is a mess of code i have set up to control 8 lights on a 595 shift register to test out the code so i can import to 
motors.py that is also hooked up to a 595 shift register hooked up to the same raspberry pi zero. when i made this code i had no
idea how the stepper motors hooked up to the raspberry pi worked. i have sinced examined much code and couldnt find any hooked up
this way. decided to put it up on git hub since i use it so much. 

lcdkeypad.py is a mess of code that i copied from other code for a 4x3 keypad and a 16x1 lcd screen that i actually found of recently is a 8x2 just side by side. i cannot get the lcd to work in 4 bit mode so changes will come for 8 bit on you guessed it a shift register. 
the shift registers are running off of shiftpi found here https://github.com/mignev/shiftpi
lcdkeypad is a straight copy for now of someone elses code. it used pad4pi found here https://github.com/brettmclean/pad4pi


#Enjoy!
